# Spark Scala master image

This image contains the Scala master process. It is used by Zoe, the Container Analytics as a
Service system to create on-demand Spark clusers in Spark standalone mode.

Zoe can be found at: https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe

## Setup

The Dockerfile automatically starts the Spark master process when the container is run.
