# Spark Scala Notebook image

This image contains the Scala notebook (https://github.com/andypetrella/spark-notebook). It is used by Zoe, the Container Analytics as a
Service system to create on-demand notebooks connected to containerized Spark clusters.

Zoe can be found at: https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/zoe

## Setup

The Dockerfile runs a start script that configures the Notebook using these environment variables:

* SPARK\_MASTER\_IP: IP address of the Spark master this notebook should use for its kernel
* PROXY\_ID: string to use as a prefix for URL paths, for reverse proxying
* SPARK\_EXECUTOR\_RAM: How much RAM to use for each executor spawned by the notebook
